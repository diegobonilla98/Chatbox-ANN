# Chatbox-ANN

My personal approach to chatbox using lazy programming.
The Neural Model (using 4 layers of 128 neurons due to very small train data set) isn't well made and just reached an accuracy of less than 5% and very big loss. Since I've tried change some hyperparameters and use k-fold and didn't succeed. My thought is that there is some problem with the categorization of the outputs and also a lack of work in feature engineering.

The thing is that seems to work fine and actually the answers are somewhat funny and accurate.
Overall I'm proud of the project since made me learn how to work with text in NN.

PD: Also It's implemented within the code language detection (google translator) so supports change of languages and the answer will match it. Very simple stuff but quite impressive.
